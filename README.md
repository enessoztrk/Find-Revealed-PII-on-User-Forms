# Find-Revealed PII on User Forms
• Users who create the form in the 'Form' structure, which is one of Jotfom's products, consciously or unconsciously write their personal information on the forms. Using this information in the form causes security issues. A study was conducted to find a solution to this problem and to identify written personal information.<br/><br/>
• The API was created with Fast API and personal information in the form can be easily determined by typing the Form ID information of the forms created by the users.<br/><br/>
