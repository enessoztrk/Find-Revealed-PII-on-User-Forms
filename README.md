# Find Revealed PII on User Forms
• Users who create the form in the 'Form' structure, which is one of Jotfom's products, consciously or unconsciously write their personal information on the forms. Using this information in the form causes security issues. A study was conducted to find a solution to this problem and to identify written personal information.<br/><br/>
• The API was created with Fast API and personal information in the form can be easily determined by typing the Form ID information of the forms created by the users.<br/><br/>

## What Is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?<br/>
• Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that, when used alone or with other relevant data, can identify an individual.<br/><br/>
• PII may contain direct identifiers (e.g., passport information) that can identify a person uniquely, or quasi-identifiers (e.g., race) that can be combined with other quasi-identifiers (e.g., date of birth) to successfully recognize an individual.<br/><br/>

## KEY TAKEAWAYS<br/>
• Personally identifiable information (PII) uses data to confirm an individual's identity.<br/><br/>
• Sensitive personally identifiable information can include your full name, Social Security Number, driver’s license, financial information, and medical records.<br/><br/>
• Non-sensitive personally identifiable information is easily accessible from public sources and can include your zip code, race, gender, and date of birth.<br/><br/>
• Passports contain personally identifiable information.<br/><br/>
• Social media sites may be considered non-sensitive personally identifiable information.<br/><br/>

## Why does PII need to be secured?<br/>
• Protecting PII is essential for personal privacy, data privacy, data protection, information privacy and information security. With just a few bits of an individual's personal information, thieves can create false accounts in the person's name, incur debt, create a falsified passport or sell a person's identity to a criminal.<br/><br/>
• As individuals' personal data is recorded, tracked and used daily -- such as in biometric scans with fingerprints and facial recognition systems used to unlock devices -- it is increasingly essential to protect individuals' identity and any pieces of identifying information unique to them.
